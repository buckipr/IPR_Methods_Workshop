# Statistical Analyses with Python

The examples from this section can be found in the Python script: [iprmw_2021_02_04.py](https://github.com/buckipr/IPR_Methods_Workshop/blob/main/Spring_2021/02_04_Python_Stats/iprmw_2021_02_04.py)
and there is also a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) which renders some of the output from the script: [iprmw_2021_02_04.ipynb](https://github.com/buckipr/IPR_Methods_Workshop/blob/main/Spring_2021/02_04_Python_Stats/iprmw_2021_02_04.ipynb)

This session includes examples of linear regression and logistic regresion, making use of the ollowing Python packages

* [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/examples/index.html)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html)
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html)
* and a little bit of [stargazer](https://github.com/mwburke/stargazer) (produces tables of regression coefficients for HTML and LaTeX)
